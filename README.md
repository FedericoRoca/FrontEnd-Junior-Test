# FrontEnd-Junior-Test

The project is about a web application in which donations can be made. The limit that we want to reach is 10,000. To make it graphic, there is a progress bar that increases as donations increase.

Project Organization:
It consists of 3 files:
* Index (html), to markup the application
* styles (css), to style the app
* animation (js), to create alerts and increase the progress bar.

Library installation:
The installation of any library is not necessary, however BOOTSTRAP  is used. 
When you use it by CDN just with the link added in "Index.html" it is enough.

Execution of the app from a local machine:
Opening the index file of any browser is enough to execute it.
